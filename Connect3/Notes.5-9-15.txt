Notes for Meeting on CSX Project - 5/9/15

Classes that we may need for the final part

- A position class for the C3 game (C3Position)
    
    *We will need to implement the reveseBoard method for this game
    
    *This game is still binary scored so we will only need to evaluate 
     for win/loss as was the case with the first two games

     *The position value should probably we represented using a simple 2d array
      as the demensions of the board will never change after intial creation.
      
- A Move class for the C3 game (C3Move)
    
    *Moves can be represented as integer values, if we rely on reverse board to
     handle the different symbols for different players (a movew will always be X from it's perspective)

- A driver class for the C3 game (ConnectThree)
    
    *This will also need methods to handle the parsing of the initial setup

- A driver for the GUI
    *I'm unsure as to how much of a GUI we need for this.
     Are we planning on representing all games through a GUI or simply the conect 3 piece of it?
     The answer to that determines how many classes we would need for the GUI. If it's just
     connect three then one should be fine.
